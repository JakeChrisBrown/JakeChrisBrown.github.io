 <h2>Paint me</h2>
  <p>I paint people  at <a href="twitch.tv/jakechristianbrown" target="_blank" class="pagelink">twitch.tv/asmrsehole</a>, if you want me to paint you just follow these easy steps</p>
  <p>First, follow me on twitch! I stream under asmrsehole several times a week mostly art related streams</p>
  <p>Second, take a photo of yourself, try and get some good lighting, moving side onto a window will give some nice shadows. Consider your angel, you can shoot front on, 3/4, or a profile, you can see some examples below</p>
  <p>Third, send an email though with the subject line "paint me" and your twitch username, you can include multiple images if unsure. Send your emails through to jakec<span>hrisbrown@gm</span>ail.com</p>
  <p>Finally, come by the stream! unfortunately it's not reasonable for me to reach out to everyone that I am painting, the best way to not miss your painting is to turn on notifcations for my stream at <a href="twitch.tv/jakechristianbrown" target="_blank" class="pagelink">twitch.tv/asmrsehole</a></p>
